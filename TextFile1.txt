TDD BASICS

Real-world industry standard stack:

	xUnit
	FluentAssertions
	Moq


What you DO write before tests

In real-world TDD, you usually create:

	-Project structure

	-Interfaces

	-Empty classes

	-Method signatures


What you do NOT do in TDD

You don’t:

	-Write the full service

	-Write the full controller

	-Write the full database logic

	-Then write tests afterward


Realistic TDD workflow


Step 1 – Define interface

Step 2 – Write first test
Test fails (no implementation yet)

Step 3 – Write minimal code
Test passes

Step 4 – Add next test
Repeat the cycle


Ask yourself:

“What is the next behavior I want this code to have?”

Then write a test for that behavior.
